\emph{Public key cryptography and the OpenPGP protocol are
  technologies which offer advantages in both security and convenience
  over traditional encryption, attestation, and authentication
  schemes. Unfortunately, standard software-based OpenPGP stacks still
  exhibit usability and security issues across a range of modern use
  cases. One way to overcome these issues is to employ SmartCard-based
  OpenPGP hardware devices designed to increase both security and ease
  of use across a wide range of settings from single sign on (SSO) to
  email security to physical access. However, OpenPGP SmartCard
  hardware is still a niche market, mainly targeted for large
  enterprises. In this paper, we explore the current hardware
  offerings and their limitations. We propose changes to existing
  hardware systems to make them more accessible to the general
  public. Additionally, we explore the role public key cryptography
  and OpenPGP might play given widespread adoption. We believe the use
  of OpenPGP should be ubiquitous and that the best way to gain such
  ubiquity in the widespread adoption fully featured, easy-to-use
  hardware.}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Public key cryptography systems form the basis of many of the 21st
century systems we rely on every day: from secure web commerce to
global financial transaction systems to remote access and
authentication. Public key cryptography systems are the foundation of
our ability to operate securely in a digital world. The most widely
used public key cryptography algorithms,
Diffie-Hellman~\cite{diffie1976} and RSA~\cite{rivest1978}, are used
in thousands of protocols enabling millions of
applications. Unfortunately, while widely deployed and understood in
technical circles, public-key cryptography and the benefits it can
provide are largely unknown or inaccessible to lay
users~\cite{whitten1999}.

OpenPGP~\cite{openpgp, rfc4880} is a standard for using public key
cryptography across a range of inter-operable applications. It
supports three core cryptographic operations: attestation (signing),
encryption/decryption, and authentication. The most common way to use
the OpenPGP standard is through a OpenPGP client
applications. GnuPG~\cite{gnupg} is a widely deployed open-source
Free-software OpenPGP client applications. Today OpenPGP best
practices include the following~\cite{matt-openpgp}:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item{\textbf{Algorithm:}} RSA-based keys are generally the preferred
  encryption algorithm, supplanting the older DSA or ElGamel
  algorithms. Elliptic Curve algorithms are the up-and-coming
  encryption standard, and will likely eventually supplant RSA, but
  RSA remains the proven standard at this time.
\item{\textbf{Key Length:}} Key lengths of 2048-bits and longer are
  generally considered secure today. 4096-bit keys are recommended for
  those concerned with attacks by APT-level advisories.
\item{\textbf{Sub Keys:}} Instead of using a single key for all
  OpenPGP operations, it is generally considered wiser to have a
  restricted master key that is used to derive a series of subkeys,
  dedicating a separate sub-key to each OpenPGP operation. This allows
  the user to separate their reputation from the actual keys they use
  on a day-to-day basis, making it easier to revoke and re-generate a
  specific sub-key in the event that it is compromised.
\end{packed_desc}

One of the key challenges in any cryptography system, including public
key cryptography systems, is where and how to securely store secret
keys. The security of cryptography systems is only as good as the
security of the associated key storage systems. Traditional key
storage practices include simply storing secret keys on the computer
on which they were generated, often protected by a user-specified
password. Such storage practice have several issues:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item{\textbf{Theft:}} Keys are susceptible to compromise in the event
  the device on which they are stored is stolen.
\item{\textbf{Malware:}} Keys are susceptible to compromise from
  malicious programs running on the device on which they are stored.
\item{\textbf{Cracking:}} Even keys protected with password are prone
  to brute force password attacks that will often succeed given
  sufficient time and computing power.
\item{\textbf{Multi-Device:}} Keys are inaccessible on devices other
  than the one on which they were created.
\item{\textbf{Ubiquity:}} Keys are inaccessible in situations where
  the storing device is inaccessible or shutdown.
\end{packed_desc}

To overcome these limitations, OpenPGP allows for the use of secure
SmartCard-based key-storage hardware. An OpenPGP SmartCard provides
the following benefits over ad-hoc software-based key-storage:

\begin{packed_desc}
\item{\textbf{Physical Security:}} SmartCards contain physical
  security measures to protect their computing and storage
  elements. Such measures strive to grantee either the physical
  security or the complete destruction of all data stored on the
  device, providing protection in the event that a SmartCard is lost
  or stolen.
\item{\textbf{Digital Security:}} SmartCards are designed to never
  allow the key's stored on them to be transferred off the card. Thus,
  even malicious applications can not extract keys from SmartCards.
\item{\textbf{Brute-Force Defenses:}} SmartCard-stored keys are
  generally protected with passwords or PINs. SmartCards are generally
  programmed to erase their one-board storage in the event of a user
  providing more than N incorrect password attempts. This greatly
  limits the ability to conduct brute-force attacks on key passwords
  or pins without destroying the key in the process.
\item{\textbf{Portability:}} Since a SmartCard is a stand-alone
  storage device, it can be moved between multiple computing devices,
  proving controlled access to OpenPGP keys across a range of
  locations.
\item{\textbf{On-Board Crypto:}} SmartCards contain on-board
  cryptographic processors capable of performing most cryptographic
  operations on-card. This limits the need to trust the cryptographic
  software on the machine on which the SmartCard is used.
\end{packed_desc}

Public key cryptography has the potential to provide the One True
Way\texttrademark{} in the world of digital attestation, encryption,
and authentication. Furthermore, these three core public key
cryptography capabilities can be leveraged to replace traditional
non-secure systems like everyday front door locks or education
credentials (\S\ref{sec:future}, increasing both security and ease of
use over the existing solutions. In order for such ubiquitous public
key cryptography uses to come to fruition we must provide simple and
secure methods of storing and accessing public key cryptography
primitives. SmartCards provide a hardware-based mechanism for proving
this simple and secure public key primitive storage platform.

\section{Existing Systems}
\label{sec:exisitng}

SmartCard technology has existed for many years. As such, there is a
variety of existing SmartCard hardware compatibly with most OpenPGP
implementations. Unfortunately, much of this hardware is designed for
large corporate environments, and isn't necessarily updates to support
modern use cases and best practices. Many SmartCards support generic
access interfaces such as the Global Platform
interface\cite{globalplatform}, allowing them to be accessed from a
common set of libraries.

The OpenPGP Card~\cite{openpgpcard} is one of the original
OpenPGP-compatible SmartCards. The card is currently in its second
major revision: version 2.0. The full specifications are available
at~\cite{openpgpcard-doc-2.0}. Core specifications are available in
Table \ref{tab:scfeatures}. The OpenPGP card is a very traditional
smart card design, requiring an external reader. It's currently
limited to 2048-bit key storage. It's fairly widely deployed and used
as the basis of products like the FSFE Fellowship
Card~\cite{fellowshipcard}.

The Crypto Stick~\cite{cryptostick} is a more modern
OpenPGP-compatible SmartCard decision. It is comprised of a single
device that includes both SmartCard hardware and a USB reader. This
system is programmable, and easy to use due to it's USB interface, but
is not hardened in the same manner as the OpenPGP card. Table
\ref{tab:scfeatures} shows the basic specs for the Crypt Stick. Full
specs are available at~\cite{cryptostick-wiki}. The Crypto Stick is
not available for purchase at the time of this writing pending a
forthcoming hardware updated scheduled for sometime in the next year.

The Yubikey Neo~\cite{yubikeyneo-openpgp-blog} is a recent addition to
the OpenPGP-compatible SmartCard market. Like the Crypto Stick, it's a
fully embedded USB-based SmartCard. It also doubles as a
One-Time-Password (OTP) generator similar to Yubico's other
non-SmartCard Yubikey products. It's based on the Java Card SmartCard
API and SDE~\cite{javacard}, and runs an open source OpenPGP
applet~\cite{yubikeyneo-openpgp-repo}. Basic specs are listed in Table
\ref{tab:scfeatures}.

\section{Toward an Ideal Card}
\label{sec:ideal}

Current SmartCard offerings fall short of the ideal SmartCard we
believe is necessary to be used in the manners we envision. In
particular, existing cards tend to lack support for longer keys and
non-RSA keys. They also have a limited number of interfaces,
insufficient to satisfy a range of use cases. We would like to see a
SmartCard will full support for a range of key types and sizes as well
as many modern wired and wireless interfaces, while still maintaining
the security afforded by traditional SmartCards. Table \ref{tab:scfeatures}
shows some specs for our ``ideal'' SmartCard.

We have been experimenting with tweaking the Yubikey Neo software to
approach our ideal card. While still work in progress, we believe that
the Yubikey Neo comes closest to what we would want in an ideal card,
and hope that software modification will get it even closer. Our
primary focus has been adding support for Key Import and larger
keys. While not successful yet, we believe that adding such support is
likely possible with additional effort.

The rational behind our ideal card specs is derived form our desire to
use SmartCard tech in all aspects of modern life while still
maintaining a high degree of security. Justifications for various
portions of our ideal spec are described below.

\begin{packed_desc}
\item{\textbf{Interfaces:}} \\ \hfill There are two interfaces which
  can be supported by the same device in order for it to be used in
  just about any setting: USB and NFC. USB is already an ubiquitous
  interfaces found on the full range of devices from PCs and laptops
  to cell phones and watches. The USB CCID specification lets a device
  act as combined SmartCard and SmartCard reader. This is an
  improvement over separate cards and readers as the latter is
  specialized hardware which is only somewhat common on business-grade
  laptops. NFC is becoming increasing popular as an interface on smart
  phones as well as point-of-sale terminals for reading credit card
  information. It provides an added convenience because the user only
  needs to swipe a token passe a reader rather than plugging it
  in. This convenience, however, comes with slightly reduced
  security. It is possible to scan NFC tokens without a user's
  consent. We propose a solution to this below, however the risk can
  also be mitigated by metallic covers.
\item{\textbf{Storage Space:}} \\ \hfill Today's SmartCards and
  OpenPGP hardware do not have adequate capacity for private key
  material. The best tokens on the market allow for three, 2048 bit
  RSA keys. However, keys of 4096 bits are becoming increasingly
  common. Therefore a device should support at least three 4096 bit
  keys for signing, encryption, and authorization. Furthermore, most
  devices only support RSA cryptography. Elliptic curve DSA is a new
  algorithm which provides the same level of strength for much smaller
  key sizes. As such, it is more appropriate for embedded and
  otherwise low-power devices. ECDSA is not as proven as RSA,
  therefore an ideal security token supports keys of both variety. In
  addition to cryptographic keys themselves, SmartCards also need
  capacity to carry other information in order to be usable in a
  multitude of settings. They should be able to store a modest amount
  of public keys, as well as important certificates
  (\autoref{sec:future}) such as a driver's license. With small USB
  flash drives on the market of over 64 GiB, and auxiliary data being
  relatively small, an additional 128 MiB or so of storage coupled
  with a SmartCard is more than reasonable.
\item{\textbf{Physical Security:}} \\ \hfill While SmartCards are
  cryptographically secure and easy to keep track of compared to a
  whole host of tokens common today, they are still liable to be lost
  or stolen. Therefore SmartCards require physical security to protect
  both their use and the private key material stored inside. To
  protect against unauthorized use while plugged in to a computer,
  SmartCards should at least have a push button. This is so that
  software on the computer cannot initiate a signing operation without
  the user being aware. Furthermore, a PIN which can be entered on the
  card itself, or via the SmartCard API should protect against
  unauthorized use should the card be obtained by an adversary. The
  SmartCard hardware (as we see in some existing offerings) will purge
  the protected key material after a set number of failed attempts. To
  protect the key material itself, SmartCards are physically hardened
  and resistant to tampering. While this is unlikely to be $100\%$
  full-proof, any attempts to open the card results in physically
  damaging it.
\item{\textbf{Cost:}} \\ \hfill Cost is an important factor in
  allowing for the widespread, ubiquitous use of public-key
  cryptography and SmartCards. Today's hardware can be purchased for
  $\$50 - \$100$ which is a reasonable expense for such an important
  piece of hardware. However, with more widespread use and economies
  of scale, we expect this cost to be reduced.
\end{packed_desc}

\section{Future Applications}
\label{sec:future}

There are many real-world applications which can \textit{technically} be
replaced or augmented by a \textit{more secure} public key based system. A fully
capable OpenPGP SmartCard however, can enable this \textit{in practice}. Such a
card will enable people to use public key cryptography throughout their
day-to-day lives.

\subsection{Certificates}

A certificate is a document cryptographically signed by a trusted party.
Cryptographic certificates can be used in place of many physical documents such
as birth certificates, diplomas, deeds to houses, auto titles, etc.

For example, a marriage license is a simple text document containing the
information found on a traditional marriage license.

\begin{verbatim}
GROOM=Bob
BRIDE=Alice
MUNICIPALITY=Boulder
STATE=Colorado
DATE=1970-01-01 00:00:00 +000
OFFICIANT=Little Bobby Tables
\end{verbatim}

The file is then cryptographically signed by the bride, groom, officiant, and
local marriage office using their respective SmartCard (or equivalent)
public-key hardware. The signed document is then stored in various places such
as the marriage office, the couple's personal storage, etc.

\subsection{Driver's Licenses}

Licenses in general are simply certificates, however a driver's license
in particular is worth discussing because it is a certificate that most people
are used to carrying at all times and displaying to people as
photo-identification for various reasons.

A cryptographic driver's license can be carried on the ideal SmartCard and
shared with others when appropriate. The license includes a certificate in the
same vain as the marriage license (above) and the signature of the states' motor
vehicle administration endorsing the holder's ability to drive. A police officer
inspecting the license will have a trusted copy of the keys of the motor vehicle
administration and can instantaneously verify any license.

\subsection{Identification}

We typically use our driver's licenses as visual identification, but in an
ubiquitous world of public key cryptography and SmartCards the infrastructure
for setting up trusted parties and new certification systems is very small. A
local authority should sign an image of its residents, but not necessarily the
\textit{motor vehicle} administration.

Like a driver's license, a person stores a signed photo (or multiple photos) of
herself on a SmartCard so that she can quickly prove that she is the rightful
holder of said SmartCard.

\subsection{Physical Access}

Physical access through doorways is already protected by security tokens in high
security environments. However gaining access to the home, child-safe rooms, etc
is more secure and more convenient with a SmartCard using near field
communication. There are already some high-tech security products entering the
market for the general population, but they are not as powerful as they would be
in an environment were we assume everyone is carrying a fully capable SmartCard.

Furthermore, using SmartCards for physical access as the norm implies that
everyone has their own key to the same door. Therefore, a home owner can
\textit{e.g.}, authorize a serviceman to enter her home and audit exactly when
he did so.

\subsection{Automobiles}

A often used physical access key is a car key. A SmartCard for entering and
starting a car is not just more secure and convenient for individuals. It is
also a way to lend your car to a friend for a specific period of time, or on
some fixed schedule. With an ubiquitous public key infrastructure, a car owner
can authorize the public key of another without exchanging secret information.

\subsection{Transactions}

In addition to certification and authentication, SmartCards can and should be
used for transactions at both online and brick-and-mortar stores. A customer is
presented with receipt describing the items and prices of the transaction,
ideally on her own, trusted device and signs it to complete the transaction. A
trusted intermediary -- a bank -- receives a transaction which is signed by two
parties and performs the agreed upon transfer. Consumers can then be far less
worried about incorrect and bogus charges on their monthly statement because
they cryptographically signed off on every transaction.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented a model for an ideal SmartCard. It is capable of storing
multiple RSA and/or ECDSA keys of 4096 (or more) bits, has both USB CCID and
NFC interfaces, is resistant to physical tempering, and is able to store small
amounts of signed data. Such a card is sufficient to replace the many documents,
credit cards and keys we manage in our day-to-day lives in a more secure
\textit{and} more convenient manor.
